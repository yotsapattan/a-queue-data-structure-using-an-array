# Queue Implementation in C
This C program demonstrates a basic queue data structure using an array. The program allows enqueueing, dequeueing, and displaying the elements of the queue.

# Files
queue.c: Contains the C code for the queue implementation.
README.md: This file, providing information about the program.
# Usage
Open a C compiler or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports C.
Compile and run the queue.c file.
Follow the prompts in the console to perform queue operations.
# Functionality
The program provides the following functionalities:

enqueue(int val): Adds an element to the end of the queue.
dequeue(): Removes and returns an element from the front of the queue.
display(): Displays the elements of the queue.
# Implementation Details
The queue has a fixed size defined by the constant SIZE.
It uses an array to store the elements.
The front and rear pointers keep track of the front and rear positions of the queue.
Error messages are displayed if an operation is attempted on a full or empty queue.
# Expected Output
The program comes with an example in the main function, demonstrating the usage of the queue functions and providing an expected output.
